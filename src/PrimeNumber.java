/**
 * A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
 * A more detailed description of prime numbers can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number
 * The Problem
 *      You will need to create logic for the following two functions: isPrime(number) and getPrimes(start, finish)
 *      isPrime(number)
 *          Should return boolean true if prime, otherwise false
 *      getPrimes(start, finish)
 *          Should return a unique, sorted array of all primes in the range [start, finish] (i.e. both numbers inclusive).
 * Note that this range can go both ways - e.g. getPrimes(10, 1) should return all primes from 1 to 10 both inclusive.
